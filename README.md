# TravelTrucks - Camper Rental Platform

**TravelTrucks** is a web application designed to allow users to rent campers
with ease. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can
search for campers based on location, vehicle type, and additional features. The
platform offers filtering options to help users find the perfect camper for
their needs.

## Features

- **Location-based search**: Users can search for available campers by entering
  a city name. The app will display campers located in the given city.
- **Real-time filtering**: Filters are updated dynamically based on user input,
  allowing for seamless and efficient searching.
- **Vehicle type selection**: Users can filter campers by vehicle type (e.g.,
  Van, Fully Integrated, Alcove).
- **Equipment filters**: Additional filters for camper equipment such as air
  conditioning, TV, etc., to further narrow down search results.
- **User feedback**: If no results are found for a given location or criteria,
  users will be notified with a helpful message.
